    <br>
    <p>Initially, the system was designed for the Young Scholars Initiative (YSI), a group of critical economists, in their goal to find and refine the 100 most important economic questions of our time. YSI wanted the process to be a collaborative effort between their community members and selected keynote speakers, done within an interactive system where all progress is made visible to all participants over time.</p>

    <p>The Cosmos was born out of these goals: it is a system to collaboratively create, refine and finally visualize data among a group of people - a real time collaborative brainstorming and visualization tool.</p>`,
